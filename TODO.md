# Current worklist

- Check the filetype support for currently shown ones and see if we could add them dynamically / everywhere
- Send a message from CEM cache to re-run diagnostics when loading is done.
- Add type hints to attributes / properties while writing them. Figure out a way to trigger completion hints when writing attributes
- Allow users to define what template literals to focus on


- Somehow utilize ESM modules at server level, while keeping vscode client at CommonJS level
