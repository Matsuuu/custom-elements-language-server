# Current worklist

- Fix metadata on JSX file operations. Currently doesn't go to correct position etc.
- We need a better pattern for the "is it js or html, try js through templates, check undefined, go straight to core" - approach

- Send a message from CEM cache to re-run diagnostics when loading is done.
- Add type hints to attributes / properties while writing them. Figure out a way to trigger completion hints when writing attributes
- Allow users to define what template literals to focus on


- Somehow utilize ESM modules at server level, while keeping vscode client at CommonJS level
