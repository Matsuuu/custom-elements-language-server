# Current worklist

- GetValidSourcefile crashes when navigating between projects
    - Problem might be in getOrCreateLanguageService(). Don't know for sure but can be replicated by
    triggering completion in one project and then opening a file in other project, and trying to get some in there. Preferably a js project
- Release
